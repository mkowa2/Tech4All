SparkHacks UIC 2023
Our vision with this app was to close the gap in today's modern technology.
We know that all groups of people experience issues with tech since it is rapidly 
changing. Therefore, our app can be used by anyone who is experiencing an 
issue with tech.We wanted to focus on the importance of volunteering and 
helping out thecommunity, which is why our support comes from volunteers. A volunteer is able to
register themselves through our link, which enters them into our database.
Volunteers can chose what criteria apply to them including certain fields of
technology and languages spoken. When a user opens our app, they are met with our
single screen layout. We decided on this because simplicity was our main concern.
Since users are in need our tech help, there was no need to make the app more
confusing with multiple pages and buttons. On their screen they can find our brand
name, instructuons, issue topics, and our volunteer link. In addition, we have made
our app billingual since Spanish is a widley spoken language. Users can then click 
on the button that applies to them, which will conncet them to a user who is
knowledgeable in that area. We created this app with Expo Go using react-native and 
CSS.
